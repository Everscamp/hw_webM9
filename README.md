I added scraper for the authors and quotes to the previous Home work.
I used comamnds "scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.csv" and "scrapy crawl authors -o authors.csv" to save result in the CSV format and then formated it into the JSON that wold be compatable with the previous homework.
Go to the quotes_spyder to use main.py
And than go to the root folder to use seeds.py script that will add new scraped data to the DB.
